                        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a multidisciplinary field that 
                        focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of performing 
                        tasks that typically require human intelligence. 
                        It involves the development of algorithms, models, 
                        and systems that can exhibit behaviors such as learning,

                        Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
                        that focuses on the development of algorithms and models that enable 
                        computers to learn and make predictions or decisions without explicit 
                        programming. ML systems learn from data, identify patterns, and make 
                        informed predictions or take actions based on that learning. Here are 
                        various subtopics that delve into different aspects of Machine Learning:
